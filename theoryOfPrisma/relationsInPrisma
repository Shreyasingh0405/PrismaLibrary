**Relations**
A relation is a connection between two models in the Prisma schema. For example, there is a one-to-many relation between User and Post because one user can have many blog posts.
**Types of relations**
There are three different types (or cardinalities) of relations in Prisma:

One-to-one (also called 1-1 relations)
One-to-many (also called 1-n relations)
Many-to-many (also called m-n relations)
The following Prisma schema includes every type of relation:

one-to-one: User ↔ Profile
one-to-many: User ↔ Post
many-to-many: Post ↔ Category
